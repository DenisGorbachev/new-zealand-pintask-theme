A New Zealand theme for Pintask
=========================

The most well-known inhabitants of this country will exchange a few glances with you while exploring board backgrounds on http://pintask.me/.

This beautiful theme is only a few lines of code, based on [Picturesque theme template](https://github.com/DenisGorbachev/picturesque-pintask-theme-template):

```css
html
  body > .content
    background-image url("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Ewe_and_lamb_in_Kent.jpg")
    background-size cover
```

_This theme is written in [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/). Plain old [CSS version](https://github.com/DenisGorbachev/pintask-new-zealand-theme/blob/master/theme.css) is available, too._

So easy to make your own theme ;)
